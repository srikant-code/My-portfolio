 It's my portfolio in progress. It is now available on mobile devices as well  
 I have tried using my whole knowledge to make this portfolio as reponsive as possible.  

## Colour Theme Used

- ![#2a2a2a](https://placehold.it/15/2a2a2a/000000?text=+) `#2a2a2a`  
- ![#006eff](https://placehold.it/15/006eff/000000?text=+) `#006eff`  
- ![#00a2ff](https://placehold.it/15/00a2ff/000000?text=+) `#00a2ff`  
  
 To modify the data in the projects section run the `generateProjects\projectsGenerator.js` script to generate the `myprojects.html` dynamically

 ```node
 node .\generateProjects\projectsGenerator.js
 ```
